# hugo-kb

A simple hugo theme to work with knowledge bases.

It supports theoretically infinite nesting of notes.

You can add custom icons for the pages and use cascade to apply the same icons to nested pages.

Wikilink metadata is generated from Obsidian using [this extension](https://github.com/lucasew/obsidian-metadump).

# Options
These are changeable using the `params` attribute in your site configuration file. See [this](https://gohugo.io/variables/site/#the-siteparams-variable) for more information.

- `disableObsidian`: ignore the `meta.json` generated by Obsidian using obsidian-metadump. This will disable backlinks and wikilinks and will make things a lot faster (~16x in my vault with ~1.1k markdown files) because the hot parts of the template are these.
